# Introduction

> Based on the [okta-scim-beta](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-scim-beta) project, this example shows how to use Okta's cloud-based SCIM connector to automatically provision and deprovision users managed by Okta into Mattermost.

This example code was written for Python 2.7 and wraps Mattermost REST APIs as a SCIM2.0 endpoint.

To install Mattermost on Windows, see  https://docs.mattermost.com/install/prod-windows-2012.html#install-windows-server-2012
